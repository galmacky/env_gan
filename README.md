Training & Test data processing:
- raw: the original files
- matched: image files that are matched (before, fire, after)
- unmatched: image files that are not matched

Methodology:
- Go to google.com and search 'california wildfire before and after'
- Save files as raw image files first, and add numbering.

- How to split image files:
- Go to pixlr.com and load the URL (or local image file)
- Choose 'crop' icon on the left, and set the 'width' as half of the original
  size.
- You don't need to execute 'apply', but can just save the selected part.
- Save as .png file format
